# IntroToOsDev
If you're interested in OS dev, this is for you!
Be carefull, this was originaly written in french and was translated (and formated in MD) using chatGPT.
I will clean up the file over time but for now this is what it is :P

The LOS folder contains the "finished" operating system.
The PracticalExercises folder contains one folder for each practical exercise as well as anothe LOS folder which is the incomplete implementation that you need to complete.

Incoming future work:
Various slide decks have been built for this Intro to OS dev but I want to re-work them in a way that fits github nicely... They will come soon.
